A reason you couldn't land an internship was despite having a decent resume and linkedIn, you simply failed the technical test. This is probably due to not having ample leetcode practice. This summer is the best time to do it, you won't get much time after it.

| [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) | This list of 150 problems offer a great introduction to leetcode, and not just leetcode, problem solving in general. Each problem is categorized into patterns which makes is alot easier than just attempting them blindfold. Some of the problems are unlocked by leetcode premium while you dont even have to learn some other patterns (bit manipulation, tries, intervals, math & geometry) so not all of 150 problems have to be attempted. |
| [Hackerank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) | I listed hackerrank as well, since it might be good to get a sense of how these two sites differ in their questions. |
| [Rossetacode](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Solutions_by_Programming_Task), [ProgrammingPraxis](https://programmingpraxis.com/contents/chron/), [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/archives), [OpenKattis](https://open.kattis.com/problems) | Similar to the above, but much more mathematical. |

These only offer a good introduction to problem solving and you'll have to work the rest by yourself.
It's worth mentioning that it's okay to look for solutions if you can't come up with your own.
