While contributing to an open source project can not replace the full experience of working at a company, it can very well teach you how people contribute and write code in a team setting.
Not to mention that if your PR gets accepted, it would mean a point on your resume! (not in all cases though)
You don't have to code up an entire feature for a product, neither do you have to remove a bug that the developers haven't yet. Your contribution can be as big as a spelling/grammar mistake in documentation, though it's always better to aim higher than this.
These few sites list a good updated collection of all such repositories where you could contribute.
