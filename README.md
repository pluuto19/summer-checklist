## About

This repository serves as a comprehensive list of skills and resources one can use to improve themselves.
While primarily for junior years (soon to be seniors) who couldn't land an internship during summer 2024, so that they don't stay as behind, anyone can benefit from it.
This repository can always improve.
Your first **open-source** contribution could be to this repository. There are no rules.

## Contribution Rules

-  If the technology/skill could benefit from a hard resource, such as a PDF or a book, please create a folder, if not already there, and place it inside the folder.
-  Otherwise, just create a tech-name.md in the root, and add an explaination of how do you think people will benefit learning from it. Add any relevant links inside the .md file.
