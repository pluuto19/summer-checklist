## About

This repository serves as a comprehensive list of skills and resources one can use to improve themselves.
While primarily for junior years (soon to be seniors) who couldn't land an internship during summer 2024, so that they don't stay as behind, anyone can benefit from it.
This repository can always improve.
Your first **open-source** contribution could be to this repository. There are no rules as to where your first contribution should be.

## Contribution Rules

-  If the technology/skill could benefit from a hard resource, such as a PDF or a book, create a folder, if not already there, and place it inside the folder.
-  Otherwise, just create a tech-name.md in the root, and add an explaination of how you think people will benefit learning from it. Add any relevant links inside the .md file.

## Miscellaneous Tech

-  Try your hands at CUDA. Everyone write code for the CPU. It would be fun to write code for the GPU. This could also lead to some cool project ideas.
-  Try integrating third party APIs into your project (anything but a weather app). [List of Open APIs](https://rapidapi.com/hub)
-  Maybe learn a NoSQL database, such a Mongo, Redis, Couch, Cassandra etc. Understandably, the use cases for the latter 3 are limited, atleast in the typical project domain, so learning them fully may not be the best pah. Instead, think of a project and how you can utilize the databases, and only learn it for that project.
-  Build a portfolio website if you already dont have one. You could choose from prebuilt templates or create your own. Getting creative with it is definitely better. You could try building a 3D interactive site using three.js. The idea is to get yourself your own platform to market yourself however you like.
-  If you're interested in cloud computing, you might also be interested devops.
